# JTT - a JailTracker tracker

JTT is a collaboration with another project:
@bfeldman89's [jail_scrapers](https://github.com/bfeldman89/jail_scrapers),
which focuses on gathering data about Mississippi jails.
Please see https://bfeldman89.com/projects/jails/ for information about this work.

As JailTracker is utilized in many places outside of Mississippi,
this code has been separated from `jail_scrapers` for those interested in similar civic hacking projects.

## On JTT
JTT uses the API of the JailTracker software suite
in order to aggregate information about inmates for civic purposes.
We're interested in answering questions about treatment of inmates, including but not limited to:
* How long are inmates held pre-trial? Pre-arraignment?
* How long are inmates being held without being charged at all, or when charges are dropped before trial?
* Does this data vary along demographic or geographic lines?

JTT is **not** for your mugshot website, and support for downloading mugshots will not be added.
